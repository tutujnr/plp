## AI for Sustainable Cities: Clustering Transport Accessibility

# SDG Focus: Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11)

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project aims to support SDG 11 by using unsupervised machine learning to cluster urban regions based on public transport accessibility. By identifying well-served and underserved areas, we can provide actionable insights for city planners and transport agencies.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Cluster regions based on:

Average walking distance to nearest public transport stop

Accessibility score reflecting quality and availability of transit

ðŸ§  Machine Learning Approach

ML Type: Unsupervised Learning

Algorithm: K-Means Clustering

Libraries Used: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

ðŸ—‚ Dataset

Source: OPTIMAP Public Transport Accessibility Data (Germany)

Format: Parquet

Features Used:

MinDistanceWalking: distance to nearest stop (meters)

scores_OVERALL: overall transit accessibility score (lower = better)

ðŸ”¬ Workflow

Load and sample data (100,000 rows for efficiency)

Group data into regional grids by rounding lat/lng

Compute average accessibility features per grid

Normalize data using StandardScaler

Use elbow method to determine optimal k (found k=4)

Apply K-Means clustering

Visualize clusters and save results

ðŸ“Š Output

Scatter plot of clusters based on walking distance and accessibility score

CSV file of clustered data: clustered_transport_accessibility.csv

ðŸ“Œ Ethical Considerations

Bias Risk: Accessibility data may not reflect informal settlements or non-registered regions

Fairness: Clustering helps identify underserved areas for more equitable urban planning

Sustainability Impact: Data-driven resource allocation improves long-term transit planning
